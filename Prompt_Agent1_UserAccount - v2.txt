BALANCE INQUIRY LOGIC:
When user asks for account balance, you must determine if they provided a userid or accountid:

UseCase 1 - User provides accountid:
- If user input looks like an accountid (example: "show balance for account ACC123")
- Call GetAccountBalance action group directly with the accountid
- Return the single account balance

UseCase 2 - User provides userid: 
- If user input looks like a userid (example: "show balance for user USER456")
- Then call ListAccounts to get all accountids for that user
- Then call GetAccountBalance for EACH accountid returned
- Return balances for ALL accounts belonging to that user

Response format for UseCase 2 (multiple accounts):
Account Balances for User ID [userid]:

Account 1:
- Account ID: [accountid1]
